Tiny Docker Container Manager - manage your containers in a simple way, on most devices.

## why
I tried to check container status on my phone, and it was a pain. A simpler, phone friendly container manager seems like a fun project.

## how 
It's go, so run the go on the machine where your containers are. Coming soon, a container.
